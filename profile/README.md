# IsSettled

A unified financial infrastructure for banks and corporates providing asset tokenization, liquidity, and CBDC, as well as ISO 20022 messaging, FX transactions, cross-border payments, clearing, and settlement — in real-time, within the same network, and 24/7/365.

# IsSettled Documentation

The documentation covers key topics on the IsSettled cloud payment solution: general theory, application scenarios, internal services, ISO 20022 financial messages, API references, business logic, terminology, and other topics, the study of which will allow us to quickly dive into the concept of the solution and begin integrating server systems of a market participant with IsSettled.

More information about the IsSettled system is available on the [developer’s portal](https://developer.issettled.com).
